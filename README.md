# BitSplit: A lottery that statistically favors higher contributions.

## This is the open-source frontend for <http://bitsplit.it>

Our concept could use the work of a designer or two with an eye towards **simple**, **clear design** and **streamlinedm user experience**.

If you feel like making some changes or tweaks, or just offering suggestions, we'd be more than happy to get your feedback.

I would be willing to offer a percentage of the revenue from this website to designers who make the design prettier, easier to use, and more functional.

We can talk numbers, if you are interested.

## Installation
* git clone https://github.com/nathanlippi/bitsplit_frontend.git
* Make sure "node" and "npm" are installed on your system.
* Go into the repository directory (contains package.json) and type "npm install".
* Install jade, globally: "npm install -g jade".
* Type  "node app.js" -- the site should be available at 127.0.0.1:3001!

## Hacking
Change a jade file, and the changes should be immediately available when you refresh!

* Simple, easy-to-understand design.
* Implement the UI for betting.
